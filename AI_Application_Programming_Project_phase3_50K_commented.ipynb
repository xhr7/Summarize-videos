            "  You probably know that it's important to eat fruit and vegetables. But do you know why? Fruit and vegetables contain some very important nutrients that our bodies need. These include vitamins, minerals and fibre. Do you know what vitamins and minerals are? Vitamin and minerals help our bodies to work properly. We only need them in smaller amounts, but we do need lots of different ones. The very best way to make sure we get all the nutrients we need is to eat a wide variety of different foods. All of the healthy food that we eat contains vitamins and minerals. To get enough of all the vitamins and minerals our bodies need, it's very important to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables. And vitamins do some very important jobs indeed. Vitamin A found in orange fruit and vegetables such as apricots and carrots and dark leafy vegetables such as the boy cabbage helps to keep our vision healthy. Vitamin B1 helps our bodies release energy from food so that we don't feel tired. Lots of fruit and vegetables contain vitamin B1 including peas, spinach and mushrooms. Vitamin C, which is found in citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, as well as in strawberries, tomatoes and broccoli, among others, is important for helping our bodies heal. For example, if we graze a knee. You can see that vitamins are really amazing. They protect us and make us strong. Fruit and vegetables are also a really important source of fiber. Fiber helps to keep our digestive system healthy. Do you know what is meant by your digestive system? Your digestive system allows your body to take in the nutrients from the food you eat, starting from your mouth, moving through your stomach, small intestine and large intestine. Fiber helps this process work properly in order to keep our bodies working as they should. We should make sure to eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day to get all of the nutrients our bodies need for them. A portion is the amount you can hold in your cup turned. And a great tip is to try and eat as many different colours as possible, so that we get lots of different vitamins and minerals. What is some of your favourite fruits and vegetables? See if you can think of fruit and vegetables to match every colour of the rainbow.\n"
